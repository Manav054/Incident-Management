STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) 12: READ-ONLY FILESYSTEM
DATE: 2026-01-12
SEVERITY: CRITICAL

1. OBJECTIVE
   Restore a filesystem that has flipped to Read-Only (RO) mode due to 
   hardware errors or corruption.

2. INITIAL TRIAGE
   2.1 Confirmation
       - Symptom: "Read-only file system" error when trying to `touch` a file.
       - Command: `mount | grep " ro,"` (Check for 'ro' flag on mount points).
   2.2 Check Kernel Logs
       - Command: `dmesg | tail -n 50`
       - Look for: "I/O error", "EXT4-fs error", "Remounting filesystem read-only".

3. RESOLUTION STEPS
   3.1 Backup (Best Effort)
       - Attempt to copy critical data off immediately if possible (read often still works).

   3.2 File System Check (FSCK)
       - Warning: Requires unmounting the disk.
       - Action: Unmount: `umount /dev/sdX`
       - Run Fix: `fsck -y /dev/sdX`
       - Note: If root partition (/) is affected, a reboot is required to force fsck on startup (`touch /forcefsck` won't work if RO; use kernel boot params).

   3.3 Remount
       - Try remounting RW: `mount -o remount,rw /mountpoint`
       - If this fails immediately, the disk hardware may be physically failing.

   3.4 Hardware Replacement
       - If VM: Detach volume, attach to recovery VM, run fsck there.
       - If Physical: Replace drive if SMART errors are present (`smartctl -a /dev/sdX`).

4. VALIDATION
   - Mount output shows `rw`.
   - `touch testfile` succeeds.
