ID: P2-OPS-004
CATEGORY: Microservices
SERVICE: Media-Processor
IMPACT: Medium - Thumbnails not generating; high-res images still work
TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-07T17:00:00Z

[LOG_CONTENT]
ERROR [Media-Svc] - Failed to process image 'user_772_avatar.png'. 
Reason: ImageMagick process exited with error code 1. 
Stack: 'libpng error: IDAT: CRC error'. 
Fallback: Serving original high-res image.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The worker nodes running the Image Resizer service were missing the latest `libpng` security patch, causing them to crash when processing specific PNG formats uploaded by users.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Scale up the 'Media-Processor' deployment with a fresh Docker image that includes updated libraries.
2. Fix: Update the base Dockerfile to pin the specific version of `libpng` and `imagemagick`.
3. Prevention: Use a vulnerability scanner like Snyk or Trivy in the CI pipeline to catch outdated OS libraries before they reach production.
