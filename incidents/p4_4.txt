[LOG_CONTENT]
[CI-Lint] WARN: Repository 'jnj-data-utils' is missing a README.md file. 
[CI-Lint] WARN: No 'contributing.md' found in root directory.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A new utility repository was initialized via CI/CD, but the developer skipped the documentation step.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: None.
2. Fix: Create a basic README.md explaining the utility's purpose and usage instructions.
3. Prevention: Update the repository scaffolding template to include mandatory documentation files.
