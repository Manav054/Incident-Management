IMPACT: Low - Internal dashboards show 10-minute stale data

[LOG_CONTENT]
INFO [Analytics-Task] - Batch processing job 'Monthly-Trends' delayed. 
Status: QUEUED. 
Current Queue Depth: 45 jobs. 
Avg Processing Time: 120s per job.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A surge in internal data export requests caused a temporary backlog in the asynchronous worker queue. Real-time transaction processing remains unaffected.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Allow the queue to drain naturally.
2. Fix: Increase the number of concurrent worker threads for the 'Analytics-Worker' service.
3. Prevention: Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for worker nodes based on 'Queue Depth' metrics.
