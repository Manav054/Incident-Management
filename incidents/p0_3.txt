[LOG_CONTENT]
CRITICAL: [K8s-Scheduler] Pod 'auth-service-v3-84f9' is in CrashLoopBackOff. 
Last State: Terminated
Reason: OOMKilled (Exit Code 137)
Memory: Usage=2048Mi / Limit=2048Mi

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The v3 update of the Auth-Service included a memory-intensive library for token encryption that exceeded the previous resource limits defined in the Helm chart.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Patch the deployment YAML to increase memory limits to 4Gi.
2. Action: If stability isn't restored, run 'kubectl rollout undo deployment/auth-service'.
3. Prevention: Integrate 'Kube-score' in the CI pipeline to validate resource requests vs. limits before deployment.
