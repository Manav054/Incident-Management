[ROOT_CAUSE]
The PDF asset was renamed in the source repository, but the hardcoded link in the "Settings" page was not updated during the CI build process.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Create a 301 Redirect in the Ingress controller from the old URL to the new PDF location.
2. Fix: Update the href attribute in the React component to point to the correct asset path.
3. Prevention: Use a "Broken Link Checker" tool as a post-deployment verification (SMOKE test) step.
