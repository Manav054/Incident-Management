[ROOT_CAUSE]
The heartbeat monitor is logging "Success" messages every second at the INFO level instead of the DEBUG level, cluttering the production logs.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: None.
2. Fix: Change the logging level for heartbeat checks from 'INFO' to 'DEBUG' in the application configuration.
3. Prevention: Define a logging standard that restricts per-second repetitive messages to 'TRACE' or 'DEBUG' levels only.
