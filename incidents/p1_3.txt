[LOG_CONTENT]
[Terraform-Apply] Error: Error launching source instance: VcpuLimitExceeded: You have reached your quota for vCPUs for running Dedicated Standard instances.
Requested: 16, Remaining Quota: 4.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A sudden surge in traffic triggered an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) expansion, but the AWS account hit the soft limit for the instance family (c5.xlarge) in the specific region.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Request an emergency quota increase via the AWS Support Console.
2. Temporary Fix: Modify the 'instance_type' in Terraform to an underutilized family (e.g., m5.xlarge) and re-apply.
3. Prevention: Setup CloudWatch alarms to notify the SRE team when resource usage hits 80% of the account quota.
