[LOG_CONTENT]
[2026-01-07 10:45:00] FATAL [Terraform-Apply] - Error: Deleting critical resource 'aws_s3_bucket.prod_assets'. 
Logic: Resource 'prod_assets' was renamed in code but not moved in state. Terraform attempting 'Destroy and Create'.
Result: 404 Access Denied for all frontend JS/CSS files.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A developer renamed a Terraform module without using the 'moved' block, causing the CI/CD pipeline to interpret it as a deletion of the old bucket.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Halt the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Restore: Point the CloudFront distribution to the S3 'Backup-Bucket' (DR site).
3. Fix: Use 'terraform state mv' to align the state file with the new resource names. Enable 'deletion_protection' on all production buckets.
