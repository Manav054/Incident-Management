CATEGORY: Container-Orchestration
SERVICE: Docker-Registry / Artifactory
IMPACT: Deployment Stalled - Nodes cannot pull images
TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-07T15:30:45Z

[LOG_CONTENT]
Failed to pull image "internal-registry.jnj.com/app/orders:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to pull and unpack image: failed to resolve reference: failed to do request: Head "https://internal-registry.jnj.com/v2/app/orders/manifests/latest": dial tcp 10.0.0.55:443: connect: connection refused

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The internal Docker registry (JFrog Artifactory) ran out of storage space on its primary mount point, causing the API to reject all incoming 'pull' requests from the Kubernetes cluster.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Clear the 'trash can' and run a cleanup policy on the registry to free up space.
2. Infrastructure: Expand the EBS volume/Disk attached to the registry server.
3. Prevention: Implement a retention policy in CI/CD to delete images older than 30 days automatically.
