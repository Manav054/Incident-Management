[LOG_CONTENT]
INFO [Lighthouse-Audit] - Image 'hero_banner.png' (4.2MB) could be compressed. 
Potential savings: 3.8MB by converting to WebP format.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The marketing team uploaded a high-resolution PNG for a banner that hasn't been optimized for web delivery yet.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: None. 
2. Fix: Convert the image to WebP format and replace it in the next content update.
3. Prevention: Integrate an automated image compression step (e.g., Imagemin) into the CI/CD pipeline for the static assets folder.
