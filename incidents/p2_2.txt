[LOG_CONTENT]
ERROR [CloudFront] - Cache Invalidation failed for path '/*'. 
Status: IN_PROGRESS (Stuck for 4 hours). 
Header mismatch: X-Cache: Miss from cloudfront. 
Result: Users receiving stale CSS files (v1.1) while JS is v1.2.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The CI/CD "Post-Deploy" script failed to trigger a global CDN invalidation due to a temporary API timeout from the cloud provider, leading to version mismatch between assets.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Manually trigger a targeted invalidation for the `/static/css/` directory via the AWS/Azure console.
2. Fix: Implement "Cache Busting" by appending unique build hashes to filenames (e.g., style.8h2k9.css) instead of relying on manual invalidations.
3. Prevention: Update the deployment script to verify 200 OK status from the CDN invalidation API before marking the build as "Success."
