[LOG_CONTENT]
npm ERR! code ERESOLVE
npm ERR! ERESOLVE could not resolve dependency node_modules/auth-lib
npm ERR! Found: react@"18.2.0"
npm ERR! Conflicting peer dependency: react@"^16.0.0 || ^17.0.0" from auth-lib@2.1.0

[ROOT_CAUSE]
An automated 'Dependabot' PR merged a minor version update for React that was incompatible with the internal authentication library's peer dependency requirements.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Revert the commit that updated 'package-lock.json'.
2. Fix: Update the 'auth-lib' to version 3.0.0 which supports React 18, or use the '--legacy-peer-deps' flag as a temporary build override.
3. Prevention: Configure CI to run 'npm audit' and dependency compatibility checks on all automated PRs before merging.
