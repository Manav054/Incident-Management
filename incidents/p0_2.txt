[LOG_CONTENT]
[2026-01-07 10:20:05] ALERT: [Ingress-Nginx] SSL Handshake failed for all incoming traffic. 
ERROR: OpenSSL: error:14094415:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert certificate expired. 
Target Domain: api.jnj-production.com

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The automated renewal script for Let's Encrypt failed due to a DNS-01 challenge timeout, and the monitoring alert for certificate expiration was misconfigured.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Manually trigger the Cert-Manager renewal via kubectl.
2. Manual Patch: If auto-renewal fails, upload a temporary wildcard cert to the K8s secret 'production-tls-cert'.
3. Prevention: Setup 'UptimeRobot' or 'Prometheus' Blackbox Exporter to alert 15 days before expiry.
