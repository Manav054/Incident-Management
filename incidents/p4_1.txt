[LOG_CONTENT]
(node:1240) [DEP0111] DeprecationWarning: Access to process.binding('http_parser') is deprecated.
Please use public APIs instead.
Stack: at Object.<anonymous> (node_modules/old-http-lib/index.js:4:25)

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A legacy internal library is using a deprecated Node.js core module. While it still functions in the current Node version, it may break in future major releases.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: None. The system remains fully operational.
2. Fix: Schedule a task to update 'old-http-lib' to a modern version or replace it with the standard 'axios' library.
3. Prevention: Implement a dependency linting tool that flags packages with high deprecation counts.
