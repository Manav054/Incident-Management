[LOG_CONTENT]
[Jenkins-Pipeline] Step 'Integration Tests' FAILED.
Error: Timeout waiting for element '#login-success-msg' after 30000ms.
Note: Test passed on 2nd retry. Status: UNSTABLE.
Build Duration: 55 minutes (expected 20 minutes).

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A "Race Condition" in the Selenium test suite where the test attempts to verify the success message before the mock authentication server has finished processing the request.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Mark the specific test case as `@Ignore` or `@Flaky` to allow the pipeline to proceed for critical hotfixes.
2. Fix: Replace hard-coded 'sleep' timers with 'Explicit Waits' that poll for the availability of the DOM element.
3. Prevention: Implement a "Quarantine" area for flaky tests where they are run separately until they prove 99% reliability over 50 runs.
