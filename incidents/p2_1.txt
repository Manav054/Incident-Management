[LOG_CONTENT]
WARN [Search-Svc] - Request latency exceeded threshold. 
Target: /v1/search/products. 
Average Latency: 4200ms. Threshold: 500ms. 
Context: Database IO Wait high on index 'idx_product_description'.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A recent CI/CD deployment added a 'wildcard' search feature that bypasses the primary database index, causing full table scans for every search request.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Disable the 'wildcard' search flag via the Feature Toggle dashboard.
2. Fix: Refactor the SQL query to use a 'Full-Text Search' index (like Elasticsearch or Gin index) instead of a standard B-tree index.
3. Prevention: Add a performance regression test step in the CI pipeline that fails the build if API latency increases by more than 20% in the staging environment.
