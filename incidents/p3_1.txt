IMPACT: Low - Cosmetic misalignment in footer
TIMESTAMP: 2026-01-07T18:00:00Z

[LOG_CONTENT]
WARN [Frontend-Sentry] - CSS Layout Error: 'flex-direction' property mismatch on '.footer-links' container. 
Detected on: Chrome v120, Resolution 1920x1080.
Context: Footer icons overlapping text in dark mode.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A global CSS refactor in the latest CI/CD build changed a utility class used by the footer, causing a minor visual overlap only in specific browser resolutions.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: None required for production stability. 
2. Fix: Adjust the CSS selector specificity for the footer container in the next scheduled sprint release.
3. Prevention: Implement Visual Regression Testing (e.g., Percy or Applitools) in the CI pipeline to catch pixel-level changes.
