[LOG_CONTENT]
2026-01-07 14:25:30 ERROR [PaymentSvc] - External API 'Stripe' returned 401 Unauthorized.
Message: "Invalid API Key provided."
Context: RequestID: req_8821x9, Environment: PROD

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The production API keys were rotated by the security team, but the Jenkins credentials store was not updated, causing the CI/CD pipeline to inject stale secrets into the container environment.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Update the Jenkins/Vault credentials with the new Stripe Production Secret Key.
2. Deployment: Re-run the deployment pipeline for the Payment service to pick up new environment variables.
3. Prevention: Implement automated secret rotation synchronization between the Cloud Secret Manager and the CI/CD pipeline.
