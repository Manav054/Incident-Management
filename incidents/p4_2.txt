[LOG_CONTENT]
WARN [Admin-UI] - Component 'UserManagment' rendered. 
Note: Property 'recieved_at' is used instead of 'received_at'.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A developer misspelled "Management" and "Received" in the internal admin tool's source code and variable naming during the initial MVP build.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: None. 
2. Fix: Rename the component and variables during the next refactor session.
3. Prevention: Enable spell-check plugins in the IDE (e.g., Code Spell Checker) and CI linting rules.
