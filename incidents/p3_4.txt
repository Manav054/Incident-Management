[LOG_CONTENT]
[Jenkins-Build] WARN: Multiple versions of 'lodash' detected in dependency graph. 
Required: ^4.17.21, Found: 4.17.15, 4.17.21. 
Note: This may cause unpredictable behavior in polyfills.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A sub-dependency in the 'Payment-Library' is pinning an older version of lodash, triggering a warning in the CI console logs even though the application functions correctly.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Acknowledge the warning; no production action needed.
2. Fix: Use 'npm-dedupe' or add a 'resolution' block in package.json to force a single version of the library.
3. Prevention: Enforce a "Zero Warnings" policy for production builds to keep logs clean and meaningful.
