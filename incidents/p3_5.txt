[LOG_CONTENT]
DEBUG [Autocomplete] - Slow response for query 'shampoo'. 
Response Time: 1540ms. 
Source: Redis Cache Miss. 
Action: Fetching from Primary DB.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
The Redis cache for common search terms was cleared during a maintenance window, leading to a temporary "cold start" for search suggestions.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: None. The cache will re-populate as users type.
2. Fix: Implement a "Cache Warming" script that pre-loads the top 1000 search terms into Redis after a deployment.
3. Prevention: Monitor cache hit/miss ratios and alert if the hit rate drops below 80%.
