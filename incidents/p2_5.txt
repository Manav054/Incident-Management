[LOG_CONTENT]
[Elasticsearch] ERROR: ClusterBlockException[blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete/api];]
Cause: Low disk watermark [95%] exceeded on node [data-node-03]. 
Impact: New logs from Production are being dropped.

[ROOT_CAUSE]
A developer enabled 'DEBUG' level logging on the 'Order-Service' in production, causing a 10x increase in log volume that filled the Elasticsearch data disks.

[SOLUTION]
1. Immediate: Revert the 'Order-Service' log level to 'INFO' via the environment config. Clear old indices using 'Curator' or manual delete API.
2. Fix: Add a larger EBS volume to the Elasticsearch data nodes and rebalance the shards.
3. Prevention: Set up "Index Lifecycle Management" (ILM) to automatically move old logs to "Cold" storage (S3) after 7 days.
